            As with icons, cursors in X and MS Windows are created in a different manner. Therefore, separate cursors 
            will be created for the different environments. Platform-specific methods for creating a {Wx::Cursor} object 
            are catered for, and this is an occasion where conditional compilation will probably be required 
            (see {Wx::Icon} for an example).
            A single cursor object may be used in many windows (any subwindow type). The wxWidgets convention is to set 
            the cursor for a window, as in X, rather than to set it globally as in MS Windows, although a global 
            {set_cursor} function is also available for MS Windows use.
